# Selenium-Testing-Demo-Python
A small project that demonstrates how to build a testing framework using Python and Selenium. This project contains Three simple smoke tests on the website https://www.python.org.

I've used the pageobject pattern and pytest as a testing framework. Also I've used Allure which is a reporting framework that creates informative and easy to read test reports.
Feel free to have a look at the code and use/modify/refactor it for your specific web testing solution.
