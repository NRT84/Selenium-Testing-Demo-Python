# Selenium-Testing-Demo-Python
A small demo project of how to build a testing framework using Python and Selenium. This project contains Three simple smoke tests on the website https://www.python.org.

I've used the pageobject pattern and pytest as a testing framework.
Feel free to have a look at the code and use/modify/refactor it for your specific web testing solution.
